project-management-tool
=======================

Followed instructions in:
https://www.gitbook.io/content/book/brookr/code-rails/chapter_1_code_rails/README.html

My approach was to try things myself first and then type along with results if that was unsuccessful, 
make sure my tests were failing before changing anything and to follow BDD to the best of my ability.
